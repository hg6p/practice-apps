  /* Solution explained:
   * - To avoid dealing with nesting, or passing around state, we use _.chain(),
   *   which wraps the value into a lodash object that can call functions we
   *   would normally need _ for.
   * - We group blogs by the author field. We now have an object that
   *   maps authors to arrays of their blogs.
   * - We map the values of that object to their lengths. We have an object that
   *   maps authors to their number of blogs.
   * - We use toPairs() to generate an array of key-value tuples (arrays: [author, blog])
   * - This is standard javascript reduce, bringing us to one author with the
   *   most posts.
   * - We unwrap the lodash object, bringing us back to a standard javascript
   *   value (a tuple / array).
   *
   * Finally, we destructure this array-tuple and return it as an object. */

  /* Solution explained:
   * The only step that differs is the mapValues step. Instead of mapping each
   * authors' array of blogs to the count of blogs, we map those arrays to their
   * combined like totals. This requires using reduce within the lambda. This
   * would look horrid if we did the nesting approach, but it looks alright here. */
